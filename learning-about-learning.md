This is a good place to come to begin to understand about neural networks and deep learning

  * this article begins with an overview of how objects in an image are recognised
  * then it goes on to describe methods used by different recognition frameworks


## Some Common Frameworks

Joseph Redmon began the [Darknet project](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet), a framework using C and CUDA. 
This has been used as the core of a lot of work by other people. 

Redmon then worked with Ali Farhadi on the [YOLO and YOLOv2 networks](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/), 
(with some interim input from Santosh Divvala and Ross Girshick)

According to Matthijs Hollemans' [Machine Think article](http://machinethink.net/blog/object-detection-with-yolo/), 
YOLOv2 is a convolutional neural network using only standard layer types: 
convolution with a 3×3 kernel and max-pooling with a 2×2 kernel 
and no fully-connected layer.
