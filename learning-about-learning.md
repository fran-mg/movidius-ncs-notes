This is a good place to come to begin to understand about neural networks and deep learning

  * this article begins with an overview of how objects in an image are recognised
  * then it goes on to describe methods used by different recognition frameworks


## Some Common Frameworks

Joseph Redmon began the [Darknet project](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet), a framework using C and CUDA. 
This has been used as the core of a lot of work by other people. 

Redmon then worked with Ali Farhadi on the YOLO and YOLOv2 networks, 
(with some interim input from Santosh Divvala and Ross Girshick)

According to Matthijs Hollemans' [Machine Think article](http://machinethink.net/blog/object-detection-with-yolo/), 
YOLOv2 is a convolutional neural network using only standard layer types: 
convolution with a 3×3 kernel and max-pooling with a 2×2 kernel 
and no fully-connected layer.
