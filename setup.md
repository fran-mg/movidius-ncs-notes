## From Windows or MacOS

Here are simple step by step instructions for setting up a guest virtual machine to run ?ubuntu so you can use the Movidius Neural Compute Stick (NCS)

Use Oracle VirtualBox to host a linux guest OS

These instructions have been tested on macOS High Sierra, but should work fine in Windows too.

## Install Virtual Box

* or you could use vmWare workstation if you prefer
* you will also need Virtual Box Extension Pack to use USB2/3
  * https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

## download Ubuntu ISO

* Current [support](https://ncsforum.movidius.com/discussion/100/product-faq) only for Ubuntu 16.04
* coming from Windows you may find it easier to use Lubuntu derivitive
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/16.04.4/release/lubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso

## create the VM

* 20GB should be more than ample
* Open the Device Settings to add Pass through PNP Device filters
  * Ports / USB 
  * Enable USB: USB3 (xHCI controller)
  * Device Filters / Add Empty / Edit
  * Name: NCS USB2 - Venor ID: 03e7 - Product ID: 2150
  * Name: NCS USB3 - Venor ID: 03e7 - Product ID: f63b
  * credit https://ncsforum.movidius.com/discussion/406/ncs-on-windows-10-with-virtualbox 
* mount the ISO in the virtual cdrom
* start up the VM
* choose Try Lubuntu 
* once the desktop opens use the Install Lubuntu icon
* use install type: Erase disk and install Lubuntu
  * this is safe because you're in a VM and the VMDK was just created empty :)
* answer install steps as you prefer
* follow through until reboot
* unmount the ISO from the VM
* reboot

## Install guest tools

This is the other part of getting the USB working properly

**Note:** when you use sudo in ubuntu you are asked for a password. 
You may find it easier to type 

```
sudo echo
```

so that you are prompted for that password (which is cached for 5 minutes) 
before you paste in code blocks

**Hint:** if you can't paste these commands into your VM from your host, 
then browse to this page _inside_ your VM :)

* Insert/ Mount **Guest Additions Cdrom**
  * in the VBox guest menu: Devices / Insert Guest Additions CD image
* Open in file manager
* press F4 to open a terminal in this folder
* Install the guest additions with the command...

```
# install the dependency 'dkms' to get guest tools installed
sudo apt install -y git dkms

sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
```

if it installed without errors then reboot (`sudo reboot`)

* Enable copy & paste
  * Devices / Shared Clipboard / Bidirectional

As a bonus, you can now dynamically resize the desktop area by dragging the window edges


## test you can pass the USB stick through to the VM

* yes, you _may_ feel excited because you are pluging in your new blue wonder
* no, it's **not** going to start doing anything awesome just yet
* plug your NCS into a USB interface on your PC
* check you can see the device in ubuntu
  * from a terminal run the command 

```    
lsusb
```

## Now you have ?ubuntu...

* Install the Movidius™ Neural Compute (MvNC) Software Development Kit (SDK)
  * NB: this is using the source code branch for the SDK VERSION 2  
  * open a Terminal window (CTRL-ALT-T)
  * paste in the following commands

```
# install the dependencies 
sudo apt install -y git make

# credit https://developer.movidius.com/start
mkdir -p ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
# using branch for new v2 - see https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk
git clone -b ncsdk2 https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk.git
cd ~/workspace/ncsdk
make install

# Test installation by running built-in examples
cd ~/workspace/ncsdk
make examples
```

### Troubleshooting

If you get odd errors when playing with the install, 
you can uninstall the SDK to try again as follows

```
cd ~/workspace/ncsdk
./uninstall.sh
cd ..
rm –rf ncsdk

```


## Next Steps

* Try the NCAppZoo stream_infer to recognise from a webcam

 * To pass through the webcam on VirtualBox use the guest Devices Menu
* learn about how the image classifier is created
